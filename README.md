# Frontend Mentor - Article preview component solution

This is a solution to the [Article preview component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### My Learnings

Up until now, I’ve mainly used jQuery for interactivity,  
but through this challenge I decided to start learning vanilla JavaScript properly.  
I think the best way to understand it is by actually building —  
so I’ll keep learning little by little through these kinds of basic projects.
